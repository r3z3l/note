If my attack or defense fails, this allows me to learn something new, change my approach, and do something differently.

### Difference Between risks, threats, vulnerabilities and exploits

#### Risks
A simple way to define risk is to consider two axes: the _probability_ that a negative event will occur, and the _impact_ on something we value if such an event happens. This definition allows us to conceptualize risks via four quadrants:

1. Low probability, low impact events
2. Low probability, high impact events
3. High probability, low impact events
4. High probability, high impact events

As cybersecurity professionals, we should always consider risk by examining the questions "How likely is it that a particular attack might happen?" and "What would be the worst possible outcome if the attack occurs?"


#### Threats
A [threat](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/pen-200/books-and-videos/modal/modules/introduction-to-cybersecurity/threats-and-threat-actors/risks,-threats,-vulnerabilities,-and-exploits#fn2) is something that poses risk to an asset we care about protecting.

###### Threat Actors
- **Individual Malicious Actors**
- **Malicious Groups**
- **Insider Threats**
- **Nation States**
#### Vulnerabilities
A vulnerability is a flaw in the system that allow a threat to cause a harm.

#### Exploits
When user start interacting the program that are intended by program by deliberately or maliciously, the user's action became an exploit.

The word _exploit_ in cybersecurity can be used as both a noun and as a verb. As a noun, an exploit is a procedure for abusing a particular vulnerability. As a verb, to exploit a vulnerability is to perform the procedure that reliably abuses it.
