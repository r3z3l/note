We can use nmap for vulnerability scanning.
There are many scripts like safe, vuln and intrusive vuln.
intrusive is so impact full that it can crus target system or service.

`nmap -sV --scrip "vuln" ip`: This will check for all vuln script in 
`/usr/share/nmap/scripts/*.nse` and gives information about it. if it's completely exploited then it will show exploit to. it gives cve information.


we can also download nse scripts from browser if we know any CVE and we can copy that nse script to nse scripts and then update nmap db using
`nmap --script-updatedb`
