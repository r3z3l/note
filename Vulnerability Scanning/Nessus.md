There are many pre-defined scans
we will be mostly using `basic scan`. it's simple and easy to use.
if we have credentials then we can better use `credential patch scan`
if we want to check if a particular CVE is vulnerable or not then we can use `advanced dynamic scan`

This will give many information like vulnerability. when its released and how to use exploit.
