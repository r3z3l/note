There can be two type of file upload

## Executable files

We can upload files that can be executed same as RFI. it's just that now we have upload file option and then somehow we are able to excute those files




## Non-Executable files

We can try to overwrite system files using upload.
Note: we should always focus on what happening on file upload. Like if you upload the same file again are we getting file exist, this gives us option to brute force and identify files. If we get error this gives us insides of technology used or language used.

we can try to override `.ssh/authorized_keys`
