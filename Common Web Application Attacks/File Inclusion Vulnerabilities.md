we can use directory traversal vulnerabilities to obtain the contents of a file outside of the web server's web root. _File inclusion_ vulnerabilities allow us to "include" a file in the application's running code. This means we can use file inclusion vulnerabilities to execute local or remote files, while directory traversal only allows us to read the contents of a file.

It can give us opportunity to obtain remote code execution.
